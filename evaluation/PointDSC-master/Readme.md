1. ply_eval folder to PointDSC main folder
  * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/rgb-d-dataset-7-scenes/
  * demo files ply_eval/color_eval and ply_eval/depth_eval manually selected depth, color for ply generation, corresponding to pairs.txt
  * The point cloud file for the test can be generated by /Hypothesis/registration_evaluate/generate_pointcloud.py
  * fx, fy, cx, cy =585,585,320,240
2. demo_registration.py into PointDSC main folder
  * Modify descriptor to "fcgf" or "fpfh" in generate_rt function.
  * Modify logfile path to save all 4*4 matrices generated by "fcgf" or "fpfh"
  * pairs.txt specify source and target point cloud, the former is the target point cloud, the latter is the source point cloud (pairs are named by the rgb corresponding to ply)
3. Run demo_registration.py
  * You can control whether to visualize the rt after each generation
  * The rt matrix generated by each group of point clouds is saved in the log file
